**Why this code was written:** 

To sort files in the specified path. 
In my case, this is the download folder. 
But you can use any folder.

_How it works under the hood:_
1. Start.
2. Creating the necessary folders (from file extensions).
3. Auto move files by sorting them by file extension.

_What can be added or improved?_
1. Sorting folders by categories of media, Microsoft, pictures, etc.
2. Creating random cats, cats are always relevant ;)

Any suggestions are welcome! Open to cooperation.

Thank you and have a nice day!
